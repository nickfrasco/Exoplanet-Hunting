Info on project is on whitepaper 

The actual testing and training data files were to large to upload to github, same with the saved models.

To generate the models run the driver.py file, enter yes to reset the models, then enter yes to save the models after theyre trained

To get access to the testing and training data use the following link:

To run the code, each model has its own main method to test itself, but to see it all in action run the demo file or the driver file
